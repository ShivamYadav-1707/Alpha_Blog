      <p style="padding-right:160px">A blog is a discussion or 
      informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of 
      discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts). Posts are 
      typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most 
      recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs 
      were usually the work of a single individual,[citation needed] occasionally 
      of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, 
      "multi-author blogs" (MABs) emerged, featuring the writing of multiple authors
       and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets,
        universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for
         an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other "microblogging" 
         systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. Blog can also
          be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog.
          There are many reasons to start a blog for personal use and only a handful of strong ones for business blogging. Blogging for business, projects, or anything else that might bring you money has a very straightforward purpose â€“ to rank your website higher in Google SERPs, a.k.a. increase your visibility.

As a business, you rely on consumers to keep buying your products and services. As a new business, you rely on blogging to help you get to potential consumers and grab their attention. Without blogging, your website would remain invisible, whereas running a blog makes you searchable and competitive.

So, the main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.

The more frequent and better your blog posts are, the higher the chances for your website to get discovered and visited by your target audience. This means that a blog is an effective lead generation tool. Add a great call to action (CTA) to your content, and it will convert your website traffic into high-quality leads. A blog also allows you to showcase your niche authority and build a brand.
